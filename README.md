# Deep learning 25_2 : Assignment Readme

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the Deep Learning class
offered by Professor Heewon Kim at Soongsil University (2nd semester, 2025).

The class is part of [RealityLab](https://reality.ssu.ac.kr/), which focuses on research 
in deep learning and related areas.

Assignments are implemented in Python with frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
